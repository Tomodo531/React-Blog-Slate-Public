# React Blog Public

This is the public version of the code used to create my blog using the MERN stack and the WYSIWYG library Slate.js.

If you want to see the blog in action then check it out at https://blog-react-slate.herokuapp.com/ . It's hosted on a free Heroku account so it might take a while for it to load if it has not been used in a while, so do not worry it is not down or I might be but hopefully not.

That's about it have a great day feel free to use the code if you want to.
