# React Blog Public

This is the public version of the code used to create my blog using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React.js, Node.js) stack and the WYSIWYG library Slate.js. The application is hosted on Heroku and images are stored in an AWS S3 bucket.

If you want to see the blog in action then check it out at https://blog-react-slate.herokuapp.com/ . It's hosted on a free Heroku account so it might take a while for it to load if it has not been used in a while, so do not worry it is not down or it might be but hopefully not.

That's about it have a great day and feel free to use the code if you want to.
